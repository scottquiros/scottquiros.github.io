I am a Spinning Instructor, while I am on my way travelling through public transport to my Spinning Class, I frequently involved in a conversation with fellow passengers for pass time. So we discussed everything until we reach the topic of "what do you do for living?", I told them that I am a Spinning Teacher, they are like: "oh! That is hard, and I don't like it.  

Their reaction was annoying, and I felt frustration because they didn't know that there are benefits to our health if we get into spinning as exercise. Choosing an indoor cycle is not as easy. You can read <a href="http://exercisebikereviewer.com/">best quality spinning bike reviews</a> on the web that suits your budget and requirements. 

Some of the Many Benefits of Spinning Class

<b>Burn Calories</b>

I started spinning class back in 2000; at first, I didn't like it because it was challenging and tiring on my legs. However, as I began to adapt to the training and noticed that there was an improvement especially on muscle definition and some loss weight so I was hooked up. A spinning exercise can burn calories with an average of 500 calories. The difficulty level of other equipment like in cardio can't burn that many calories in such moment of time. 

<b>Improve Cardiovascular Health</b>

To keep you fit and increase body weight and body mass, Spinning can use as an activity of exerting your muscles. Spinning has aerobic benefits too, an activity that increases the needs of body oxygen. Spinning classes are both good for endurance and cardiopulmonary exercise.

<b>Progress at Your Own Pace</b>

For the first timer you don't need to force yourself to work hard with your spinner bike; you can do it at your speed and convenience. So you won't fall behind the rest of the class and won't feel strange for not knowing the fitness routine, you can increase your speed as you go on.

<b>Experience how time flies</b>

On the spinning class, the challenge is changing now and then. As you work on each level, there is a tendency that you forgot the time. Your spinning instructors can promote positive mental disturbance by using some visualization techniques and language, and you forget how time passes so fast while you are enjoying your workout.

<b>Enjoy an Effective, Low Impact Workout</b>
